AI/ML-based mental health disorder detection and prediction app.

# ðŸ§  Smart Mental Health Risk Classifier

This project is an AI/ML-based intelligent web application that helps users assess their mental health by predicting possible mental health disorders through a series of user-driven questionnaires. It also classifies the severity of the detected condition (Low, Medium, or High Risk) and provides personalized recommendations such as yoga, diet, or doctor consultations.

## ðŸŒŸ Project Objectives

- Detect multiple mental health disorders using ML models.  
- Use questionnaire-based input from users.  
- Classify disorder risk into Low, Medium, or High.  
- Recommend health actions based on the predicted risk level.  
- Provide a responsive web application interface using Streamlit.  
- Ultimately contribute to awareness and early detection of mental health issues.  


# Technologies Used #
Python
Pandas / NumPy
Scikit-learn
Streamlit
Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualizations, optional)

# Features #
Predicts disorders like depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, etc.
Uses real or synthetic datasets.
Recommends self-help activities or professional consultation.
Responsive UI (planned via Figma + Streamlit)
Final goal: Publish research paper and host the web application
